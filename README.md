# 1) Introduction to Unity Scripting - Sheep Game

This is the first game in the portfollio for ID623001 Intro to Algorithmic problem solving. In this game you have to rescue sheep by shooting hay bales at them before they run off the edge world. The rate at which the sheep spawn and their run speed increase over time to increase the difficulty. The game ends when the player fails to rescue 3 sheep, causing a game over. The Highscore is saved for multiple playthroughs until the game is closed.
